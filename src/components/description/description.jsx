<div className="title"> Who Are We </div>
<p>Welcome to the RcCrafters website.  We manufacture scale landing gears for Remote Controlled jets and airplanes.  Our designs are scale enough for static competition and durable for for flight use.  Each set is custom tailored to the scale and weight of the aircraft.   </p>

<div className="title"> How Do We Do It </div>
<p>All designs are scaled from photos of the "real" full size aircraft or factory blueprints.  After scaling them down to the desired size, the gear is then drawn to scale in CAD.  From there, the CAD drawings serve as the blueprints to the machining process.  All the steps are completed in house on our mill and lathes.  After trial assembly is completed, the gear is broken down and all pieces are bead blasted.  Final finish is left to the consumer.</p>
